                 <input type="checkbox" class="larger"><p>3 large  <b>eggs</b> at room temperature </p>

                 </p>
                 <h2>Instructions</h2>
                 <button>1</button><p>Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and 
                    preheat oven to 350&#8457;(177&#8451;).</p>
                 <button id="bt-2">2</button><p><b>Make the crust:</b> Using a food processor,pulse the 
                     crackers into cumbs.pour into a medium bowl and stir in sugar and melted
                     butter until combined.(you can also pulse it all together in the food processor.)
                     Mixture will be sandy.Press firmly into the bottom and slightly up the sides of a 
                     9-inch or 10-inch springform pan.No need to grease the pan first. I use the 
                     bottom of a measuring cup to pack the crush down tightly.Pre-bake for 
                     8minutes.Remove from the oven and place the hot pan on a large piece of 
                     aluminum foil. The foil will wrap around the pan for the water bath in step 4.
                     allow crust to slightly cool as you prepare the filling.</p>
                 <button>3</button><p><b>Make the filling:</b> Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment
                     ,beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed ina large bowl
                     until the mixture is smooth and creamy,about 2 minutes.add the sour cream,vanilla extract,and lemon juice  then beat
                     until fully combined.on medium speed,add the eggs one at a time,beating after each edition 
                     until just blended.After the final egg is incorporated into the batter,stop mixing.
                     To help prevent the cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it cools,avoid over-mixing the batter 
                     as best you can.

                 </p>
                 <button>4</button><p><b>Prepare the simple water bath(see note):</b>Boil a pot of water.You need 1 inch of water in your 
                     roasting pan for the water bath,so make sure you boil enough.I use an entire kettle of hot water.As the water is heating up,wrap the aliminum of 
                     foil around the springform pan.Pour the cheesecake batter on top of the crust.Use a rubber spatula or spoon to
                     smooth it into an even layer.palce the pan inside of a large roasting pan.Carefully pour the hot water inside the pan and place in the oven.
                     (or you can place the roasting pan in the oven first,then pour the hot water in.Whichever is easier for you.)      
                 </p>
                <button>5</button><p>Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost set.When it's done,the center of the cheesecake will slightly 
                     wobble if you gently shake the pan.Turn the oven off and open the oven door slightly shake the pan.Turn the oven off and open the oven door slightly.
                     Let the cheesecake sit in the oven in the water bath as it cools down for 1hour.Remove from the oven and water bath,then cool cheesecake completely at room temperature
                     Then refrigerate the cheesecake for atleast 4 hours or overnight.
                </p>   
               <button>6</button><p>Use aa knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the springform pan,then remove the rim.Using a clean sharp knife,cut into the 
                     slices for serving.For neat slices,wipe the knife clean and dip into water between each slice.
               </p>           
               <button>7</button><p>Serve cheesecake with desired toppings.Cover and store leftover cheesecake in the refrigerator up to 5 days.</p>
